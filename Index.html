My name is Nevaeh Ruble I graduated high school on May 18th 2024. My plan is to go to college for four years at Buena Vista University.I have shot archery for school for three years, and on my own I have shot for 5 years. I plan on shooting archery when I am there and working in the library during my first year at least, this is nice because I have always loved to read books. Plus an upside to working in the library durring college is that I get paid to do my homework. My passion is working in the kitchen, I started that when I turned 14. My family consists of my father (Tanner) mother (Molli) sister (Alaina) brother (Bryson) youngest sister (Kimber).
